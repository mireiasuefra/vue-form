# Vue.js Form

## About The Project

Experimenting with Vue.js

This is a small project in which you will find a multistep form with different views to complete and a final summary.

## Built with 🚀

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) as a javascript framework.
* [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) as a a state management.
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as CSS framework.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) as a component library 
* [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup?activeTab=readme) as a JavaScript schema builder for validation. 
* [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/) as a form validation library for Vue.js 

## Getting Started ⚙️

- First install the dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

- To run the project locally

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Decisions 📚

For the implementation of this project, as a personal challenge, I have relied on several tools:

- Use [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) to start a Vue 3 project in an easy way.
- For the the form I used the libraries [VeeValidate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/v4/) and [Yup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yup?activeTab=readme) to validate the form, and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to style the inputs and buttons.
- However, for the layout of the ODS and Summary views I preferred to do it with Flexbox and without bootstrap.
- To manage the state management between the different steps I used [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/).

## Improvements 📝

- I would have liked to add the step for favourite books to the exercise, including a fetch to [this api](https://demo.api-platform.com/docs). Time constraints and since it is not a framework I am used to, have not allowed me to do so.
- Deploy the project on a hosting service.
